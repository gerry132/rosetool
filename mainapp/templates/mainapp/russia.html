        <h1>Week 2: Russian Constructivism</h1>
        <p> Vladimir Tatlin visited Pablo Picasso's studio in 1913 where upon viewing Picasso’s 
          experiments with collaged objects (papiers collés) which were 3 dimensional models made from scrap metal was inspired to 
        make his own. The artists in Russia who adopted this aesthetic became known as the Russian Constructivists. Withn constructivism the
        artist was transformed into an engineer who worked with tools rather than merely a brush and it was their role to help the masses to 
        become aware of class divisions and social inequalities. In 1923 a manifesto was 
      written that reflected the ideals of this group of designers it surmised that:
    </p>
    <p style ="font-style: italic; margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%">"the material formation of the object is to be substituted for its aesthetic combination. The object is to be treated as a whole and thus will be of no discernible ‘style’ but simply a product of an industrial order like a car, an aeroplane and such like. Constructivism is a purely technical mastery and organisation of materials." (Constructivism – Art Term | Tate, 2020)</p>

  <figcaption style ="font-style: italic; font-size: smaller;">Fig 2: Alexsander Rodchenko's work </figcaption></figure>
  <p>The most distinctive characteristic of the Constructivists style was the use of geometric shapes, repeated patterns, 
    perspective distortions and limited blocky colour scheme mainly the use of red, black and white.
   The movement emerged at a pivotal point of Russian history where communism took hold and overthrew the traditional ruling elite, constructivism 
   reflected this shift rejecting traditionalism and embracing nonsuperfluous design. A perfect example of this style is embodied in the Alexsander Rodchenko's poster seen here on the left.

  </p>
  <p style = "font-style: italic; margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;">"They attempted to 
   find the Communist expression of material construction. Building and science were emphasised over artistic expression, 
   and Constructivism reached as far and wide as architecture, design, fashion, 
   and mass-produced objects. Construction ruled over, for example, classic painterly concerns such as composition." (Learn about Constructivism and Constructivist Artists | Artland Magazine, 2020)</p>

  
        <P >Many examples of the aesthetic can be seen on album covers such as for the electro band Kraftwerk, who not only used this visual imagery
          on their album covers but integrated it into their onstage performances and fashion. The album The Man-Machine has all the characteristic
          of Constructivisim such as limited colour palette and diagonal shapes and lines.
        </P>
        
        <figure style = "width:90%; height:90%" ><img src = "/static/mainapp/kw.jpg"  width="width" height="height"  style = "padding-bottom:0.5em; width: 80%; height:80%" >
          <figcaption style ="font-style: italic; font-size: smaller;">Fig 3: The Man-Machine – album cover for Kraftwerk, 1978
            Design by: Karl Klefisch, Günther Fröhling, El Lissitzky, “Beat the Whites with the Red Wedge”, 1920 </figcaption></figure>  

        
  
        <p> Another example of Russian Constructivism in popular culture can be seen in the band Franz
          Ferdinand who used its visuals for their album covers and music videos. Their album 'you could have it so much better' is essentially 
          a homage to Alexsander Rodchenko's iconic poster.

        <br>

        <p>Again another example of this style is seen on Led Zepplins album Mothership. The geometric blocky shapes and colour 
          tone is very reminisent of the aesthetic.

        <P>With my introduction to Russian Constructivisim I decided to give it a try with a collage I created in Photoshop</P>
