<h1>Week 5: Pop Art</h1>
   <p>Pop Art as an art movement emerged in New York City in the 1950's. Some of the most famous artists associated with this type of
     art are Andy Warhol, Jasper Johns, Richard Hamilton and Roy Lichtenstein. Pop art is characterized by its portray of popular 
     cultural tropes and distorting the perception of such items to the viewer. It was a commentary on the increasing material obsessed 
     capitalist culture and the power of advertising. A great example of this is Andy Warhols iconic piece the soup cans, the image of 32 identical soup cans
     was a reflection of mass produced consumer culture, Warhol "puts the item front and centre, with little embellishment, and forces society to reflect on what consumerism means to each individual."
   (Beetham, 2015) </p>

<p>To create many of his prints Warhol used a silk screen process which ironically was originally invented 
  for the advertising industry. Warhol himself started out as a commerical artist being commissioned to create 
  illustrations for adverts. The mechanical process of the silk screen process and the almost production line assembly also 
  harkened again to mass-produced consumer goods. Ironically once his popularity started to decline his studio known as The Factory 
  began to concentrate "on mass-producing art that would sell: that is, commercial 
  souvenirs of the avant-garde that Warhol called "Business Art""" ("Andy Warhol's Pop Art Portraits: Characteristics of Silkscreen Paintings" 2020)

<p>Another prominent arists of the period was Roy Litchenstein, his work is charactaerised by the use of comic imagery again referencing 
themes in popular culture.</p>

<p>I made an attempt an creating an image in the pop art style and tried to emulate Andy Warhols work using this tutorial:

  <p>Popart has inspired many artists and elements of its aesthetic can be seen throughout the art world today. An example of an artist heavily
    inspired by Pop Art is French artist Jerome Clem. In his work he uses images from popular culture such as figures from well 
    known brands such as disney and reimagines them in a different context.
