      <h1>April Greimanâ€™s impact on design and other creative industries
      </h1>
          <p>April Greiman was one of the first graphic designers to embrace computer technology as a medium for creating art, nowadays
            graphic designers see a computer as an indespinsible tool but many of her contemporary's feared the increasing amount of digitalization
          </p>

      <p style= "font-style: italic;">"This fascination comes from the core of her being, a core of perpetual curiosity and questioning that fuels her desire to explore and inspires the cutting-edge design work that places her at the helm of integrated design at the close of the twentieth century"</p>
    
      <h1>Influences</h1>

      <p>She describes her style as a blend of "...technology, science, word and image with color and space..."</p>
     
        <img src="/static/mainapp/weingart.png" style = float:left> <p >Greiman studied at the Basel School of Design in Switzerland, 
          it was there that she was introduced to the New Wave style by Wolfgang Weingart who had been teaching his students his this technique 
          since the 1970's. The New Wave style was heavily influenced by
        Punk culture and the Swiss style and took many elements that characterised the Swiss style and distorted and 
      warped them. Letter spacing became widened and the consistency of font style, sizes and orientation varied even within a word
      in essence breaking all the fundamental rules of Typography single word.</p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <h1 style="clear: both;">Comparative Analysis</h1>
      <p>

      </p>

      <p>Technology is advancing at an exponential rate and with this artists have embraced these new tools in new and innovative waves.

        <p> Nowadays we take the digital tools we use for granted but when April Greiman
          she only had a 1 Megabyte computer at hand with a monochrome 9 inch display.
