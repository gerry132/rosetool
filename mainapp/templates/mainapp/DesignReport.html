        <h1>Design Report</h1>

        <H2 id="goals"> Introduction</H2>

        <p>April Greiman was one of the first designers to embrace computers as a graphic design tool and created iconic
            images that defined
            the 80's and 90's, "She has been called a pioneer in this regard, making it acceptable for a graphic
            designer
            to explore their craft using a computer." (Smith, 2009). At the time her designs and the methods she used
            were thought as being radical but it also
            earned her great acclaim, designer Massimo Vignelli said that she was
            “by far the most daring and meaningfully experimental graphic designers in the world,
            her work is extremely intellectual and extremely emotional at the same time.” (Whiteson, 1988)

        <H2 id="goals"> Early Life</H2>

        <p>Born in 1948 in New York city April had a creative mind from a young age. Her father was of the earliest
            computer programmers and was
            introduced to technology as a child. She attended Kansas City Art Institute an
            upon graduating decided to further her studies at the prestigious
            Basel School of Design in Switzerland. She moved to Los Angeles and it was there that she established
            herself as an
            ground-breaking artist that changed the landscape of design forever.
        </p>

        <H2 id="goals"> Cultural Context</H2>
        <p>The MAC computer was released in 1984 and with it came software tools that offered graphic capabilities.
            April Greiman began
            to use this then new technology to create innovative pieces of art that were never before seen. The Mac then
            came with a bitmap
            editor known as MacPaint, a vector based graphics program called MacDraw, and a word-processor called
            MacWrite. With her
            training in graphic design from the Basel school in Switzerland and the techniques she picked up from the
            Swiss style and
            Weingart's radical New Wave style she used the new technologies introduced by MAC to create her own
            distinctive style.

            The first major piece she created was a fold out poster for Design Quarterly titled 'Does it make sense?'.
            The fold out sent
            out shock waves in the design community many were aghast at the usage of technology to create a graphic
            piece to be
            featured in a well-known magazine.

        </p>

        <p style="font-style: italic; margin-left: 10%; margin-right:20%;">“The people--mainly other designers--who were
            threatened by my innovations were the most bitter.
            But these criticisms, by forcing me to articulate my ideas, only served to sharpen my style.” ("A Designing
            Woman With Radical Ideas : April Greiman Says Her Graphics Style Is 'an Experiment in Creating "Hybrid
            Imagery" '" 2020)</p>

        <figure>
            <img src="/static/mainapp/makesense.jpg" style="display: block; width:50%; height:50%; margin-left: 20%; ">
            <figcaption style="font-style: italic; font-size: smaller;margin-left: 20%;">Fig 2: Does this make sense by
                April Greiman (1986)</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>The two page spread was 6 feet long and was a life size digital portrait and created using the forementioned
            programs on the Mac computer
            and had to print in seperate segments with each segment taking the whole night to complete. She would often
            send it to print before
            she left the studio to have it ready for the next day. Her intention behind this piece was to offer an view
            of what technology was
            capabile of and as she stated was inspired by the notion by philiosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein “If you give it
            a sense, it makes sense.”
            (Ocegueda 2020)

        </p>

        <p style="font-style: italic; margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;">"Using my professional video equipment and
            new software and hardware from Apple I composed a full-sized portrait
            of myself and handed off to the printer a stack of dot-matrix printed paper with a low resolution, 512k
            image.
            It was both terrifying and exhilarating.
            Learning something new in technology and exposing myself personally to demonstrate a transmedia idea."
            ("Neshan 27: Face to Face/ Made in Space; An Interview with April Greiman/ Majid Abbasi" 2020)</p>

        <p> Her process was very complex and included a variety of mediums. An example of her process is laid out in the
            creation of the Modern Poster for the MOMA
            museum in New York. Firstly she would create a background using video images and transfering the image to
            the computer using
            the Mac paintbox tool. Secondly she would add sketches, photographs and textures. Lastly "This “layered”
            image is laser scanned to magnify the light-point pixels that make up the computer image.
            Each magnified pixel thus becomes a unique and separate geometry of tones and colors." (WHITESON, 1988).
            In the finished piece elements of her Swiss Style trainning can be seen such as the use of a grid layout and
            skewed perspectives.

        <br>
        <p>However by far her greatest influence came form her mentor and teacher Wolfgang Weingart who worked at the
            Basel school of art.</p>

        <h2 id="goals">Style</h2>
        <p>Much of April Greimans work as been informed by her education at the Basel school of design in Switzerland.
            Her
            work contains elements of the Swiss style but most notably it is heavily inspired by her mentor Wolfgang
            Weingart. Wolfgang
            Weingart is credited as being the originator of the style, it was intended to break on conventions of design
            practice and
            because of its non-conformist leanings it is heavily associated with the punk movement of the 70's. Like
            punk it was seen
            as a rejection of modernist values.
        </p>
        <p style="font-style: italic; margin-left: 20%;">As traditional attitudes came to be considered outdated,
            society rebelled against the mainstream and demanded change. (Hyndman, 2019)</p>

        <figure style="Float:left; width: 60%; height:60%">
            <img src="/static/mainapp/punk.jpeg" style="display: block; width:50%; height:50%; margin-left: 20%; ">
            <figcaption style="font-style: italic; font-size: smaller;margin-left: 20%;">Fig 5:Sex Pistols album
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>The new wave style is characterized by alternating sizes such as letting of differing size, font, spacing or
            width.
            Punk and the new wave movement promoted the ethos of DIY design and this is the main reason that April
            Greiman embraced
            new computer technologies as it allowed her to have direct access to typefaces as previously graphic
            designers needed
            to commission a typesetter to create the type giving them little visibility in the process.(Hyndman, 2019).
            Greiman also
            used various mediums to create her work such as photographs, textures and sketches very much echoing the DIY
            aesthetic of Punk.
            Greiman was also a fan of using geometic shapes in her work playing with their perspectives to give the
            illusion of a 3-Dimensional
            object in a 2-Dimensional space.
        </p>
        <figure style="width: 70%; height:70%">
            <img src="/static/mainapp/calarts.jpg" style="display: block; width:90%; height:90%; margin-left: 20%; ">

                Odgers 1979 Poster for California Institute of the Arts </figcaption>
        </figure>



        <h2 id="goals">Impact on Graphic Design</h2>
        <p>There are many contempoary artists that have emulated this style for example Irish designer Aoife Dunne. Like
            April Greiman she
            uses computer generated graphics that are reminiscent many of her designs she is quoted as saying "I always
            saw technology as my paintbrush."
        </p>

        <figure style="Float:left; width: 80%; height:80%">
            <img src="/static/mainapp/aoife.jpg" style="display: block; width:90%; height:90%; margin-left: 20%; ">
            <figcaption style="font-style: italic; font-size: smaller;margin-left: 20%;">Fig 7: Tranzemorex | Aoife
                Dunne at EP7 Gallery, Paris</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p style="clear:both  ;">The use of computer graphics and the varied use of colour, pattern and texture is quite
            reminiscent of April Greimans work. Aoife Dunne creates
            an interactive sensory experince through her work. Like Greiman she is multidisciplinary but takes Greimans
            work even
            further by creating her own websites and animations. She describes her style as post-pop or post-internet
            which are movements that
            takes cues from 90's and early 2000's internet culture.
        </p>
        <p>Being very adapt at creating graphics she created an installation called Limitless which is an immersive
            video game world infused
            with trippy graphics. In the video there are many elements that are inspired by the new wave style such as
            varying font sizes and
            dense patterns.

        </p>

        <p style="clear: both;">Here is another example of her work:</p>

        <p></p>

        <H2 id="goals"> Conclusion</H2>
        <p>Advances in technology informed a lot of April Greimans work in the 80's, the introduction of the personal
            computer and
            graphic capabilities allowed her to create a whole new style and helped normalise the use of technology in
            Graphic Design so what does the future hold for graphic design, how will technology chnage? </p>

        <p>We are witnessing a great paradigm shift in regards to graphic design in use, we are creating a greater
            distance
            with design and traditonal methods mainly print even now graphic design is highly dependent on technology.
            3D technology and augmented reality will most certainly be something graphic designers be working with.
            Augmented reality defined as "a view of the real, physical world in which elements are enhanced by
            computer-generated input" and this
            means graphic designers will start to create things that are not confined to a page or screen but be
            integrated with the users everyday
            reality.
        </p>

        <p>Its strange to think that not that long ago the thought of using a computer to genreate art was thought as
            being akin to heresy. For every graphic artist a computer is an essential part of their work and to some it
            is their work. April
            Greiman was able to give us a hint at the possibilites technology held for the evolution of design in a
            sense she open the door.
